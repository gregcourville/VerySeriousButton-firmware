# VerySeriousButton-firmware
Firmware code for the Very Serious Button (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/very-serious-button).

## Credits
VerySeriousButton-firmware relies on the LUFA library (http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php), and is based in part on LUFA example code.
A copy of the LUFA-110528 source is bundled with the VerySeriousButton-firmware code, patched to correct a bug in the `HID_Device_ProcessControlRequest` function (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lufa-support/amUnLYLDOG8/r9Llgu8f0skJ).
